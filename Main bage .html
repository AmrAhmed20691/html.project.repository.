What Is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence or AI provides a computer program the ability to think and learn on its own. It is a simulation of human intelligence (hence, artificial) into machines to do things that we would normally rely on humans. There are three main types of AI based on its capabilities - weak AI, strong AI, and super AI.

Weak AI - Focuses on one task and cannot perform beyond its limitations (common in our daily lives)
Strong AI - Can understand and learn any intellectual task that a human being can (researchers are striving to reach strong AI)
Super AI - Surpasses human intelligence and can perform any task better than a human (still a concept)
